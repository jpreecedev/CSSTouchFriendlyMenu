        <h2>About Jon Preece</h2>
        <p>I am currently a Software Developer working for <a title="Parasol Group" href="http://www.parasolgroup.co.uk/" target="_blank">Parasol</a>, which is part of the <a title="Optionis" href="http://www.optionis.co.uk/" target="_blank">Optionis</a> group of companies, based in Warrington, Cheshire (UK).  I have been writing software since the late 1990's as a hobbyist, and I have worked professionally in a several roles since 2008.  I am very enthusiastic about keeping up with the latest technologies and I believe in constant education to improve my skills and productivity.</p>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I completed a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree at the <a title="University of Chester" href="http://www.chester.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Chester</a> in 2010, finishing within the top 5% of all students, achieving a classification 1 (First Class) degree with honours. This is to date one of my proudest achievements.</p>

        <p>Since the end of University, I have become a Microsoft Certified Professional (MCP).  You can <a title="MCP Transcript" href="https://mcp.microsoft.com/Anonymous//Transcript/Validate" target="_blank">view my current transcript here</a>.</p>

        <h3>Career</h3>
        <p>I started my career working as a Junior Software Developer at <a title="Fantastic Media" href="http://www.fantasticmedia.net/" target="_blank">Fantastic Media</a>, where I developed a range of software including Bluetooth Advertising Software (written in C#, Windows Forms) and websites written in PHP/HTML 4.</p>

        <p>My next moved led me to <a title="System C Healthcare Ltd" href="http://www.systemc.com/" target="_blank">System C</a>, where I worked on desktop software written in both Windows Forms and WPF for the healthcare industry, particularly the NHS.  Whilst there, I learnt a great deal about writing enterprise software for use by a large range of users with varying competencies, as well as how to write software for a range of platforms.  I earned a promotion to mid-level developer, and became a well-respected team member.  I often gave training workshops to help share my skills with other team members.</p>

        <p>I then moved to Yellowbus Solutions Limited, where I lead a small team on a bespoke WPF application for the haulage industry. This project involved determining the client’s requirements, writing functional specifications, and designing and developing the application front to back. I liaised with the customer on a regular basis, giving progress updates and generally keeping the project on track. The solution was well received, with minimal bugs/incorrect functionality, and has gained significant traction in the market.</p>

        <p>Currently I work as a mid-level web developer, working on various projects written in ASP .NET WebForms and ASP .NET MVC.  I also get daily hands on experience of JavaScript, HTML 5, CSS 3 and many other technologies.</p>

        <h3>Aspirations</h3>
        <p>It is my goal for 2014 to complete Microsoft's MCSD (<a title="Microsoft Certified Solutions Developer" href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en-us/mcsd-web-apps-certification.aspx#fbid=eoWQGCSY9Tu" target="_blank">Microsoft Certified Solutions Developer</a>) training course to further improve my technical ability.  I intend to complete this before April 2014.</p>
