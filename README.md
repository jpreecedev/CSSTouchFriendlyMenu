CSS Touch Friendly Menu
====================

CSS touch screen menu, with a dash of JavaScript and a sprinkle of Modernizr.  Designed to work as a normal hover menu on devices that do not support touch capabilities, or as a toggle menu on devices with a touch screen.

Loosely based on the great work done by [Chris Spooner from Line25.com](http://line25.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pure-css-dropdown-menu)


Demo
